# Some dockerized applications

Using docker presumably is a good way to isolate applications on linux that may mess with your general system setup. My motivation is mostly processing and creation of midi files, which require to fiddle a lot with your sound output settings. Goal of this is to have docker environments for rosegarde (linux DAW with great midi support) and connecting external midi controllers.

## list of environments

 - [xeyes](./xeyes) Proof of concept for running GUI applications in docker
 - [jupyter](./jupyter) Running a jupyter server with write access to host directory
